                    This will be for those who want to see their magic decks at a glance and have the utility to edit
                    their decks virtually.
                    <p>Some of the tools that users may find here is; 
                        <ul>
                            <li>The number of cards permitted in a given game mode</li>
                            <li>The card 'colors' being used in each deck</li>
                            <li>Suggestions for how to use the various mechanics</li>

                <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How do I make a good deck?</li>
                    <li>What are some tips and tricks to deck building?</li>
                    <li>What sets are 'Standard legal'?</li>
                    <li>What else could I try to have more fun with my decks?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    People who have been collecting Magic the Gathering cards over the years may be looking
                    for some tool that can assist them with keeping track of all of them. Or, those who are
                    new to the game may not know how to put a deck together so they can have fun with their
                    friends while still feel like they made the deck themselves (instead of their friend
                    creating it for them). This website will benefit both types of players.

                <h3>A Logo</h3>
                <p>Probably just use a big 'M' or something</p>

                <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
                <p>
                    I think having a grayish white background with the authentic brown that matches the color
                    of the Magic cards would be cool. I could have red highlights and dark gray to show more 
                    character too.

                <h3>Typography to be Used</h3>
                <p>
                    I will probably just use the simple 'cursive' for my typography.
